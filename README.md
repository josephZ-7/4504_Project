# 4504_Project

To properly run the code, you'll need to first compile all files, then run them in this order:

- ServerRouter
- Server
- Client

If you run them out of order, e.g: Client before Server, the Client will just error out and you'll need to run it again.
I fixed the issues with not routing properly and not communicating properly, wasn't too bad. 
I also re-added file IO for message passing.

Uploaded all files into the /main folder of the github so we'd all be working from the same starting point.
