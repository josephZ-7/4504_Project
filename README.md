# 4504_Project

To properly run the code, you'll need to first compile all files, then run them in this order:

- ServerRouter
- Server
- Client

If you run them out of order, e.g: Client before Server, the Client will just error out and you'll need to run it again.

To adjust the number of threads, the threadCount variable needs to be changed in both the Server and Client.
To adjust the size and amount of matrices, the matrixSize and numberOfMatrices variables need to be changed in the Client.
